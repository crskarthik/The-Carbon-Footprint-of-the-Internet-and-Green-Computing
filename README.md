> ## Facts
- Average website releases 4,700 lbs. of CO2 for every 10,000 page views, which is equivalent to driving a car for 5,109 miles according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Green House Gas Emissions. 

- Data center electricity consumption is projected to increase to roughly 140 billion kilowatt-hours annually by 2020, the equivalent annual output of 50 power plants, costing American businesses $13 billion annually in electricity bills and emitting nearly 100 million metric tons of carbon pollution per year.

- The internet releases around 300 million tons of CO2 – as much as all the coal, oil and gas burned in Turkey or Poland in one year, or more than half of those burned in the UK.

- 343.5 million tons of CO2 was down to consumer and commercial ICT in 2005 – equivalent to around 1.2% of current fossil-fuel CO2 emissions. ICT's footprint is due to climb by 60% by 2030.
